Hi, I’m Nathan, a first-year PhD student working on multi-robot systems, with a particular focus on swarm robotics.

My research explores how large groups of relatively simple robots can coordinate to produce robust, scalable, and elegant collective behavior. I’m drawn to swarm systems because they embody a compelling balance: decentralization removes single points of failure, distributes decision-making, and enables the system to tolerate uncertainty and individual breakdowns—yet still achieve coherent, coordinated outcomes.

I’m especially interested in application and system integration. I care about taking ideas beyond simulation, building them into real hardware, and pushing them out of the lab into real-world environments where robustness truly matters. Ultimately, I’m motivated by turning theoretical concepts into reliable, deployable systems that can operate outside controlled settings and solve practical problems.
